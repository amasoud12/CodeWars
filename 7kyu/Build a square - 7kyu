I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.

Example
n = 3, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:

+++
+++

solution 

def generate_shape(n):
    l= []
    for x in range(n):
        l.append("+"*n)
    return '\n'.join(l)
