#Get the averages of these numbers

Write a method, that gets an array of integer-numbers and return an array of the averages of each integer-number and his follower, if there is one.

Example:

Input:  [ 1, 3, 5, 1, -10]
Output:  [ 2, 4, 3, -4.5]
If the array has 0 or 1 values or is null, your method should return an empty array.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

solution 

def averages(arr):
    avg = 0
    lst  = []
    if arr is None or len (arr) < 2:
        return []
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if i > 0:
            avg = (arr[i] + arr [i - 1])/2
            lst.append(avg)
    return lst
