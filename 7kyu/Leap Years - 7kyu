In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.

solution 

def is_leap_year(year):
    if year %4 ==0:
        if year %400 ==0:
            return True
        if year %100 ==0:
            return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False
