Task
Given a positive integer n, calculate the following sum:

n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ...
All elements of the sum are the results of integer division.

Example
25  =>  25 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 47

solution 

def halving_sum(n): 
    total = 0
    while n >= 1:
        total +=n
        n = n//2
    return total
