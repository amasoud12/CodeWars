In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return a list of ints detailing the count of uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters (everything else), as follows.

The order is: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

"*'&ABCDabcde12345" --> [ 4, 5, 5, 3 ]
More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!

solution 

def solve(s):
    upperCount, lowerCount, intCount, specialCount = 0, 0, 0, 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            upperCount += 1
        elif char.islower():
            lowerCount += 1
        elif char.isdigit():
            intCount += 1
        else:
            specialCount += 1
    return [upperCount, lowerCount, intCount, specialCount]
