Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.



solution 

def disemvowel(string_):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'] 
    lst = []
    
    for word in string_.split(' '):
        newWord = ''
        for char in word:
            if char not in vowels:
                newWord += char
                
        lst.append(newWord)
    
    return ' '.join(lst)
