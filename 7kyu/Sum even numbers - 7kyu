Complete the function that takes a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of the even values of this sequence.

Only numbers without decimals like 4 or 4.0 can be even.

The input is a sequence of numbers: integers and/or floats.

Examples
[4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 10, 6, 7, 9, 8]  -->  30   # because 4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30
[]                               -->  0


solution 

def sum_even_numbers(seq): 
    sum = 0 
    for num in seq:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum
