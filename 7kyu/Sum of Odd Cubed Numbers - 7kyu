Find the sum of the odd numbers within an array, after cubing the initial integers. The function should return undefined/None/nil/NULL if any of the values aren't numbers.

Note: Booleans should not be considered as numbers.

solution 

def cube_odd(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr: 
        if not isinstance(num, int) or isinstance(num, bool)s:
            return None
         
        cube = num ** 3
        
        if cube % 2 != 0:
            total += cube

    return total
