Given a string which is a word, return True if the word has adjacent double double letters, like in 'balloon'.

For example,

'balloon' -> True, 'lloo' are adjacent double double letters

'baaloon' -> False, because even though there are two double letters, they are not adjacent

'baboonn' -> True, here 'oonn' are adjacent double double letters

'matte'   -> False, because there is only one pair of double letters

'aaaaaaah'  -> True, any substring 'aaaa' makes it a word with adjacent double double letters

Note: all the words will be lowercase, without any symbols or spaces

solution 

def adjacent_double_double_letters(word):
    for x in range(0, len(word) -3):
            if word[x] == word[x+1] and word[x+2] == word[x+3]:
                return True 
    else:
        return False
