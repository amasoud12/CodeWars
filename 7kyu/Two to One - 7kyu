Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string (alphabetical ascending), the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

solution 

def longest(a1, a2):
    seen= []
    for i in a1:
        if i in seen:
            continue
        seen.append(i)
    for i in a2:
        if i in seen:
            continue
        seen.append(i)
    return ''.join(sorted(seen))
