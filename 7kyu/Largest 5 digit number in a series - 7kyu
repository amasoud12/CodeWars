In the following 6 digit number:

283910
91 is the greatest sequence of 2 consecutive digits.

In the following 10 digit number:

1234567890
67890 is the greatest sequence of 5 consecutive digits.

Complete the solution so that it returns the greatest sequence of five consecutive digits found within the number given. The number will be passed in as a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. The number passed may be as large as 1000 digits.

def solution(digits):
    max_sequence= 0
    for index in range(len(digits) -4):
        sequence= int(digits[index:index+5])
        if sequence > max_sequence:
            max_sequence= sequence
    return max_sequence
