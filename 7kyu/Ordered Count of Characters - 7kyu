Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

ordered_count("abracadabra") == [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('r', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 1)]

solution 

def ordered_count(inp):
    dict = {}

    for char in inp:
        if char in dict:
            dict[char] += 1
        else:
            dict[char] = 1
            
    return list(dict.items())
