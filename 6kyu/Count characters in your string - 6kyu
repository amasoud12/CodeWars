The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

solution 

def count(s):
    result= {}
    for x in s:
        if x in result:
            result[x]+=1
        else:
            result[x]= 1
    return result
