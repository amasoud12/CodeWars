Kata Task
I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

solution 

def human_years_cat_years_dog_years(human_years):
    if human_years == 1:
        return [1,15,15]
    elif human_years == 2:
        return [2, 24, 24]
    if human_years >=3:
        return[human_years, (human_years-2)*4 +24, (human_years-2)*5+ 24]
