Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

Constraint:

1 <= month <= 12

solution 

def quarter_of(month):
    if month in ['january', 'february', 'march', 1, 2, 3]:
        return 1
    elif month in ['april', 'may', 'june', 4, 5, 6]:
        return 2
    elif month in ['july', 'august', 'september', 7, 8, 9]:
        return 3
    else:
        return 4
