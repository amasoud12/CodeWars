You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

solution 

def positive_sum(arr):
    summation= 0
    for i in arr:
        if i > 0:
            summation += i
        elif len(arr) == 0:
            return 0
    return summation
