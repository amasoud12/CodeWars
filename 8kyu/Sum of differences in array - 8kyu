Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

Example
[2, 1, 10]  -->  9
In descending order: [10, 2, 1]

Sum: (10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9

If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be 0 (Nothing in Haskell, None in Rust).

solution

def sum_of_differences(arr):
    differences= 0
    new_arr= sorted(arr, reverse= True)
    if len(new_arr) <= 1:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(len(new_arr) -1):
            diff= new_arr[i] - new_arr[i +1]
            differences += diff
        return differences
